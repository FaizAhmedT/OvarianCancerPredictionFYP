# OvarianCancerPredictionFYP
The Final Year Project of our Undergraduate Degree in Bioinformatics was about Ovarian Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning.
Early detection of ovarian cancer has always remained a challenge due to its varying 
symptoms and lack of screening tests. Our thesis aims to address this issue by 
implementing several machine learning models and explainable AI methods. We have 
utilized a comprehensive Kaggle dataset that contains various genetic markers and clinical 
attributes of individuals. The approach involves 5 specific ML models: Support Vector 
Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. These 
models achieved accuracies of 78.3%, 72.9%, 78.3%, 75.6%, and 85.1% respectively. We 
also implemented 5 Ensemble methods to evaluate the performance of these models for
accuracy. These methods were Stacking, Boosting, Bagging, Max Voting, and Ensemble 
Combination. We also have incorporated different explainable AI methods like SHAP 
Permutation Importance, Partial Dependence Plot, SHAP Dependence Contribution Plot, 
and Tree Explainers to understand the output of those models and ensure that they are 
reliable. The objective of this project is to improve the diagnostic procedure for ovarian 
cancer through earlier detection and improved patient outcomes. A limitation worth 
nothing in this research is the creation of a potential bias. It was created as the data available 
for our project was imbalanced in terms of the different genetic profiles. In the future, 
researchers can focus on utilizing genetic information to expand on the prediction of 
ovarian cancer. Such datasets can enhance the predictive capabilities of deeper ensemble 
techniques. This way, researchers can further refine their prediction accuracy and model 
evaluation for ovarian cancer prediction.
